# test_spy

This repository is meant to test the `spy` Rust crate.

The `master` branch doesn't work because the `spy` crate has this issue:

</p>

To solve it and to see if my solution works, I've created a [working branch](https://github.com/otaviopace/test_spy/tree/works) that creates a local `spy` crate with the corrections needed. That branch compiles and works :tada:
